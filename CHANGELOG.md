### v1.0.0
* Initial release

### v1.0.1
* Somehow managed to break it right before release so now it actually works.

### v1.0.2
* Fixed healing reduction not applying in subsequent runs (I forgot to initialize a variable).

### v1.0.3
* Made optimizations (to a few of my mods) to reduce load.
* Increased enemy move speed bonus to 30%.
